Howdy!

We are reaching out to you as the Student Recruitment Team for Connect 2024 at St. Mary's Catholic Center in College Station, TX. 

Attached is a bulletin post that we would ask you to include in the bulletin for [Parish Name]. This post invites incoming students to Texas A&M University and Blinn College to attend the Connect Retreat. Our mission at Connect is to welcome incoming students home to St. Mary's by cultivating meaningful friendships and inviting them to a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ. The students who attend Connect will be equipped to remain devoted to our God and Holy Mother Church during college. 

Registration opens May 1st, so we would like to have the post published in the bulletins for the weekends of April 27th-28th, and May 4th-5th, if possible.

We appreciate you for helping us reach every student that we can. The transition from high school to college can be tough, but with your help at [Parish Name], we can strive to love and welcome all Aggie Catholics into their new home here at St. Mary's, encouraging them to remain faithful in their relationship with God during college.

Will you be able to publish this bulletin post? Please let me know whether that works for you. 
Also, if there are any questions or concerns, please feel free to email Arianny Putera at arianny.putera@gmail.com. Thank you!
