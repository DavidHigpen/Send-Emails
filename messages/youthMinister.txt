Howdy [Youth Minister Name]!

We are reaching out to you as the Student Recruitment Team for Connect 2024 at St. Mary's Catholic Center in College Station, TX. Connect is a process that welcomes incoming freshmen and transfer students at Texas A&M University and Blinn College. It culminates in a two-day retreat in mid-August.

As you may know, many young students who have been blessed to grow up in a Catholic school or parish environment lose their faith in college. Our mission is to glorify God by responding to this problem, and we would like you to join in our efforts. We welcome incoming students home to St. Mary's by cultivating meaningful friendships and inviting them to a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ. The students who attend Connect will be equipped to remain devoted to our God and Holy Mother Church during college. 

Would you help us bring souls Him? We have attached different tools, such as flyers, social media posts, etc., which you can use in your own community. Please help us promote this invaluable opportunity with the incoming students at your school or parish.

We appreciate you for helping us reach every student that we can. The transition from high school to college can be tough, but you can help us ensure all Aggie Catholics feel loved and welcomed into their new home here at St. Mary's. If there are any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to email Arianny Putera at arianny.putera@gmail.com. 

Can we count on you to fight for Christ's Kingdom?
